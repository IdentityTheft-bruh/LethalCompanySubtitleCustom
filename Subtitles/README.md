### Adding/Updating Subtitles

As a Deaf individual, I only can do so much. Admittedly I've noticed that some subtitles I configured [in here](https://github.com/JanGuillermo/LethalCompany/blob/main/Subtitles/Constants.cs) are not accurate, and so, I would love very much to have your assistance there to make the game more accessible for all.
